# RobBoatGame
=============
Alpcapatrol's boat game.  srsly.

Plot
----
Very story-based.  You're on a boat, and you travel from island to island and see what you find.  you do not fight on the boat.


Mechanics  
---------
roughly 60 minute game time, 8 levels of islands, 7.5 minutes per game  choose one island, and move to the next island 

### Combat System

40% or more of the game time

imagine you get a sword.  and say the sword is good quality.  i don't want the sword to have a damage quality, because i don't really like that in videogames, like, i don't like the difference between getting a sword at level 5 and level 45 and the damage difference is insane, that doesn't make sense.  The difference in damage would be very 

The sword will come with cards, like a thrust card and a slash card and an overhead swing sword, and the number of cards depends on the quality.  and a low quality sword has a "fumble" card.

So for combat, you draw cards, and you play the cards against your enemy.

### Health  
For health, say you have 10 points of stamina, and stamina and health are the same thing.  Each action costs you stamina points, and you use them up and they come back each turn.

But say you get wounded, that decreases your total stamina pool.  

Also wounds add a separate effect to your combat, something negative.

### Other
Maybe you could burn a card for a temporary stamina boost
maybe you could hold a card until the next turn to get extra damage
